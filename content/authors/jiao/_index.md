I am Jiao Yu. I am currently a postdoctoral associate at the Yale University, [School of Public Health](https://ysph.yale.edu/). My research focuses on examining the **social determinants of health** over the life course, with a particular interest in the intersection of environment, aging, and health disparities. My current studies focus on two fronts: First, I investigate biopsychosocial pathways linking neighborhood environments and later life mental and cognitive health. Second, I explore how social and behavioral factors, such as digital engagement and time use patterns influence health disparities among older adults. As a quantitative researcher, I utilize contemporary **machine learning** methodologies and **longitudinal trajectory modeling** to draw inferences from large-scale nationally representative longitudinal surveys in my research.

Previously, I worked at the [University of Minnesota's population center](https://isrdi.umn.edu/) examining environmental impacts on women's health and contributed to the [IPUMS PMA Data Analysis Hub](https://tech.popdata.org/pma-data-hub/), which provides hands-on R tutorials on data visualization and analyses.
