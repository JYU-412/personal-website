I am Jiao Yu. I am currently a postdoctoral associate at the Yale University, [School of Public Health](https://ysph.yale.edu/). My research focuses on examining the **social determinants of health** over the life course, with a particular interest in the intersection of environment, aging, and health disparities. My current research investigates  how reproductive history patterns shape old age health outcomes and  how bio-physiological and contextual factors affect health disparities among older adults. I utilize contemporary statistical methods and machine learning methods — particularly **longitudinal trajectory models** and **sequence analysis** to draw inferences from nationally representative longitudinal surveys — in my research.

Previously, I worked at the [University of Minnesota's population center](https://isrdi.umn.edu/) studying environmental impacts on women's health and contribute to the [IPUMS PMA Data Analysis Hub](https://tech.popdata.org/pma-data-hub/), which provides hands-on R tutorials on data visualization and analysis.
