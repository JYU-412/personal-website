abstract: Women in Africa may have experienced conflicting pressures during the COVID-19
  pandemic. While the unpredictable nature of the pandemic was prompting some women
  to delay pregnancies, the pandemic was potentially limiting access to reproductive
  health services due to supply shortages, fears of virus exposure, and mobility restrictions.
  In this study, we used longitudinal data from Kenya and Burkina Faso and applied
  a multilevel perspective to better understand the factors contributing to change
  or persistence in contraceptive use during the early months of the pandemic. We
  found a marginal increase in contraceptive uptake in the early days of the pandemic.
  Multilevel logistic regression results revealed that interpersonal trust and accurate
  knowledge of COVID-19 precautions were associated with a greater likelihood of initiating
  contraception. These factors appeared to have provided women with confidence to
  navigate the complicated COVID-19 landscape. At the same time, we observed a decrease
  in contraceptive use in regions with high COVID-19 cases, suggesting the virus was
  limiting access to contraception in some contexts. These findings highlighted the
  need for public health officials to ensure that women have the necessary knowledge
  and ability to safely access contraception during public health crises, when overall
  demand for contraception may be increasing.
