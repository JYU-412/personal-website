 abstract = {This study examines temporal and racial/ethnic patterns in social engagement among older adults from 2019 to 2022, using data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) for adults aged 60 and older (n = 13,605). Social engagement was operationalized as time spent on five activities in in-home and out-of-home settings. Descriptive analysis was used to characterize temporal trends of social engagement, and zero-inflated negative binomial regression was utilized to estimate year-specific racial/ethnic differences. Results indicate an initial decline in out-of-home social engagement, followed by a gradual recovery. Racial differences in social engagement became salient during the pandemic period. The evolving racial and ethnic patterns in social engagement underscore the challenges that Black and Hispanic older adults faced during the public health crisis. Understanding activity patterns specific to racial/ethnic groups has implications for targeted interventions, informing strategies to support Black, Hispanic, and other minoritized older adults in public health emergencies.},
