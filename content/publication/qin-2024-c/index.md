abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Neighborhood factors of social isolation have been understudied,
  hindering efforts to reduce social isolation at the neighborhood level. This study
  aims to investigate the longitudinal effects of neighborhood social cohesion and
  physical disorder on social isolation in community-dwelling older adults, as well
  as to examine whether race/ethnicity moderates the neighborhood-isolation relationship.
  METHODS: We used 11-year data from the National Health and Aging Trend Study, a
  longitudinal national study of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older. Social
  isolation was measured through a summary score across four domains: marital/partner
  status, family and friend contact, religious attendance, and club participation.
  A series of weighted mixed-effects logistic regression models were performed to
  test the study aims. Sample sizes ranged from 7,303 to 7,291 across individual domains
  of social isolation. RESULTS: Approximately 20% of participants reported social
  isolation. Findings indicated a negative association between neighborhood social
  cohesion and social isolation. Higher levels of neighborhood social cohesion were
  longitudinally associated with lower odds of social isolation (odds ratio [OR],=,0.52,
  95% CI: 0.47-0.58). Yet, the presence of neighborhood physical disorder was associated
  with an increased risk of overall social isolation ([OR],=,1.2, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.44).
  Race/ethnicity significantly moderated the effects of neighborhood social cohesion
  and physical disorder on social isolation. The odds of no in-person visits associated
  with neighborhood social cohesion are smaller among Black adults compared to White
  adults. Black adults had constantly lower odds of isolation from religious attendance
  compared to White adults regardless of the level of neighborhood social cohesion.
  Hispanic adults had decreased odds of having no friends associated with signs of
  physical disorder, while no associations were found among older White adults. White
  adults had higher odds of isolation from in-person visits when living in neighborhoods
  with signs of physical disorder, whereas no association was observed among older
  Black and Hispanic adults. CONCLUSIONS: This study elucidates the role of neighborhood
  characteristics in shaping social isolation dynamics among older adults. Furthermore,
  the observed moderation effects of race/ethnicity suggest the need for culturally
  sensitive interventions tailored to address social isolation within specific neighborhood
  and racial contexts.'
