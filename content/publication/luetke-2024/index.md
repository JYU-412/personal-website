abstract: The mental and physical toll of conflict-related stressors—such as safety
  concerns, food insecurity, and loss of income—may have significant and deleterious
  impacts on birth outcomes among pregnant women. Armed conflict disrupts people’s
  lives, often limiting access to essential resources and healthcare services (e.g.,
  abortion-related healthcare). We investigated the relationship between armed conflict
  and pregnancy termination among pregnant women (aged 15–49) in Burkina Faso using
  health data from the Performance Monitoring for Action (PMA) project and armed conflict
  event data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Project (UCDP). We found that pregnancies
  exposed to armed conflict in the first trimester were less likely to end in pregnancy
  termination compared to pregnancies that were not exposed to armed conflict in the
  first trimester, though we are unable to disentangle spontaneous versus induced
  terminations in these data. Thus, we cannot determine whether this finding is driven
  largely by one type of abortion or another, nor can we be sure that the effects
  are not counteracting each other. Because interruption of healthcare access is a
  common consequence of armed conflict, abortion-related services should be targeted
  and adapted to suit the specific needs and obstacles faced by pregnant women in
  conflict-affected places.
