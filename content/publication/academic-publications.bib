  abstract = {Social inequality has grown dramatically in many societies over the last several decades, compelling attention to its causes and consequences. This chapter reviews the issue of life course inequality from a cohort-based perspective. Much work using this approach has focused on economic inequality, often emphasizing its links to health and other consequential domains. The tendency for economic inequality to increase over the life course has been observed in numerous advanced industrial societies. Both sociological and psychological accounts have been offered to account for this phenomenon. In sociology, the cumulative dis/advantage (CDA) approach has identified social processes operating at macro-, meso- and micro-levels that serve to generate and sustain increases in inequality over the life course, By contrast, the notion of psychosocial accentuation is sometimes advanced by psychologists to suggest that increasing inequality results from individual-level differences in talent and effort. One way to ‘test’ these two competing hypotheses – both purporting to account for intra-cohort increases in inequality – is, ironically, to examine within-cohort patterns comparatively between cohorts, or across societal settings. That is because if trajectories of inequality are influenced by social processes, they could be expected to vary between cohorts (or societies) that encounter different social policies and/or historical events. However, if increasing inequality occurs as a simple consequence of the distribution of individual talents, such trajectories should be little disturbed by historical events, policy innovations or other forms of social change. Available evidence suggests that, at least for the measure of income, changes in economic conditions, social policy and other relevant characteristics have been associated with alterations in the patterning of life course inequality.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In this study, we explored the effect of zinc supplementation on markers of inflammation and monocyte activation in antiretroviral therapy-treated HIV infection. METHODS: This is a phase I open-labeled randomized double-arm study, exploring the efficacy and safety of zinc supplementation on inflammation in ≥18-year-old people living with HIV in the US, on stable antiretroviral therapy and with zinc levels ≤75 µg/dL in the last 60 days. Patients were randomized 1:1 to zinc gluconate capsules at a dose of 45 mg (low-dose), or 90 mg (high-dose) elemental zinc daily for 16 weeks. We assessed inflammatory and gut integrity biomarkers at baseline and 16 weeks. RESULTS: Overall, a total of 52 participants were enrolled (25 participants in the low-dose arm and 27 participants in the high-dose arm). Median (Interquartile range) age was 49 (38, 60) years, 77\% were men and 73\% were African Americans. At baseline, median zinc levels were 73 (64, 86) µg/dL. Median circulating zinc levels increased to 91 µg/dL in the low-dose arm and to 100 µg/dL in the high-dose arm. Overall, 48\%-60\% of participants experienced a reduction in biomarkers levels. The margin of reduction ranged between 8\% and 21\%. This change was meaningful with large effect size (Cohen D ranging from 5 to 19). CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, we found that zinc supplementation is effective at increasing circulating zinc levels. In addition, our findings provide novel data suggesting that zinc can affect a biological signature in people living with HIV and modulate biomarkers associated with clinical comorbidities.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is evidence for endothelial dysfunction in youth living with perinatally acquired HIV (YLPHIV). However, little data exist on its mechanisms. METHODS: YLPHIV and age-matched HIV-uninfected (HIV-) youth enrolled in the Cape Town Adolescent Antiretroviral Cohort in South Africa between 9 and 14 years of age were included. YLPHIV were on antiretroviral therapy more than 6 months with viral load less than 400 copies/ml at baseline and 24 months. Serum biomarkers of systemic inflammation, monocyte activation, intestinal integrity, and oxidized LDL-cholesterol were measured at baseline and after 24 months. Endothelial function was measured at 24 months using reactive hyperemic index (RHI); endothelial dysfunction was defined as RHI less than 1.35. Spearman correlation coefficient and quantile regression were used to examine associations between RHI and different biomarkers. RESULTS: We included 266 YLPHIV and 69 HIV- participants. At baseline, median (Q1, Q3) age was 12 (11, 13) years and 53\% were females. YLPHIV had poorer endothelial function compared with HIV- youth (RHI{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1.36 vs. 1.52, P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.01). At baseline and 24 months, YLPHIV had higher markers of monocyte activation (soluble CD14), gut barrier dysfunction (intestinal fatty acid binding protein) and oxidized LDL-cholesterol (P{$\mkern1mu$}≤{$\mkern1mu$}0.04) compared with HIV- youth. Among YLPHIV, soluble CD14 remained associated with endothelial dysfunction after adjusting for age, sex, Tanner stage, and antiretroviral therapy duration (β: -0.05, P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.01). CONCLUSION: Despite viral suppression, South African YLPHIV have poor endothelial function and persistent evidence of monocyte activation and gut barrier dysfunction compared with HIV- youth. The long-term clinical significance of gut integrity and monocyte activation needs to be further assessed in YLPHIV.},

The relationships among the lipidome, immune activation, and subclinical vascular disease in children with perinatally acquired HIV (PHIV) have not been investigated. METHODS: Serum lipid composition, including 13 lipid classes constituting 850 different lipid species were measured by direct infusion-tandem mass spectrometry in samples from 20 ART-treated PHIV and 20 age-matched and sex-matched HIV- Ugandan children. All participants were between 10 and 18{$\mkern1mu$}years of age with no other known active infections. PHIVs had HIV-1 RNA level 50{$\mkern1mu$}copies/ml or less. In addition, common carotid artery intima--media thickness (IMT), as well as plasma marker of systemic inflammation (hsCRP, IL6, sTNFRa I), monocyte activation (soluble CD14 and CD163), and T-cell activation (expression of CD38 and HLA-DR on CD4+ and CD8+) were evaluated. RESULTS: Median age (Q1, Q3) of study participants was 13{$\mkern1mu$}years (11, 15), 37\% were boys, 75\% were on an NNRTI-based ART regimen. The concentrations of cholesterol ester, LCER, phosphatidylcholines, and sphingomyelin lipid classes were significantly increased in serum of PHIV compared with HIV (P≤0.04). Biomarkers associated with CVD risk including hsCRP, sCD163, and T-cell activation were directly correlated with lipid species in PHIV (P{$\mkern1mu$}≤{$\mkern1mu$}0.04). Contents of free fatty acids including palmitic (16{$\mkern1mu$}:{$\mkern1mu$}0), stearic (18{$\mkern1mu$}:{$\mkern1mu$}0), and arachidic acid (20{$\mkern1mu$}:{$\mkern1mu$}0) were positively correlated with IMT in PHIV. CONCLUSION: Serum lipidome is altered in young virally suppressed PHIV on ART. A direct association between inflammation and lipid species known to be associated with CVD was observed.},

  abstract = {Background:~         Predicting ultimate lower extremity length is important in the treatment of lower limb length discrepancy (LLD), congenital limb deficiency, and other etiologies. Utilizing skeletal age over chronological age improves the prediction of ultimate lower extremity length. The recently described modified Fels knee skeletal maturity system allows for skeletal age estimation via imaging always available in LLD patients. We sought to compare the accuracy of the modified Fels knee skeletal maturity system versus chronological age in ultimate limb length prediction of a modern adolescent clinical population.         Methods:~         The medical records of all patients treated at our institution over a 20-year period with unilateral lower extremity pathology and available lower extremity imaging before and after reaching skeletal maturity were reviewed. Skeletal maturity was defined radiographically by closed distal femoral, proximal tibial, and proximal fibular physes. The femoral, tibial, and lower extremity length was measured in all radiographs. The modified Fels knee skeletal maturity system was applied to all radiographs obtained before maturity to estimate skeletal age. The accuracy of 3 widely utilized lower extremity length prediction systems was compared when utilizing estimated Fels skeletal age versus chronological age inputs.         Results:~         A total of 245 radiographs (109 before maturity) from 43 patients were eligible for inclusion. On cross-sectional analysis, linear modeling using Fels skeletal ages was uniformly associated with higher (improved) R2 values than chronological age-based models. On longitudinal analysis, skeletal age mixed-effects models had significantly lower (improved) Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion values than chronological age models in all cases. Cohen d values were also significantly different (P{$<$}0.05) for the skeletal age models compared with chronological age models in all cases.         Conclusions:~         In the treatment of LLD, the modified Fels knee skeletal maturity system can be readily applied to available imaging to improve the prediction of ultimate femoral, tibial, and lower extremity length. This skeletal maturity system may have significant utility in the estimation of ultimate LLD and determination of appropriate timing of epiphysiodesis.         Level of Evidence:~         Level III.},

We also examine the influence of physicians' emotional support and patients' demographic as well as health characteristics on patients' satisfaction. SAMPLE: Our sample includes interviews with 806 community dwelling older adults (mean age =77.82 years, SD=8.41). The sample included residents of a large retirement community in Clearwater, FL, USA. Respondents were also included from representative samples of older adults living in Orlando and Miami, FL, USA, and Cleveland, OH, USA. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using multiple hierarchical regression analyses, we found that patients' age and functional limitations were negatively associated with their care satisfaction. When compared with White patients, African-American patients were less satisfied with their physicians while Latino patients expressed greater satisfaction with their medical care. We found limited evidence of patients' self-advocacy and such advocacy did not serve as a significant predictor of satisfaction with physicians. In contrast, patients' perception of physicians' readiness to act as patient advocates was a significant predictor of patients' satisfaction. Emotional support of physicians was also associated with patients' satisfaction. CONCLUSION: These findings raise questions about consumer empowerment among older adults and underscore their desire for and appreciation of physicians' advocacy. Findings are discussed in the context of power imbalance between elderly patients and their doctors.},

  abstract = {Introduction:~         Successful outpatient anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction hinges on effective analgesia. Routinely, oral narcotic agents have been the preferred analgesic postoperatively in orthopaedic surgery. However, these agents have several known adverse effects and are associated with a potential for abuse. This study evaluates the efficacy of ketorolac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with analgesic properties, as an adjuvant agent for postoperative pain control after ACL reconstruction.         Methods:~         Adult patients undergoing primary ACL reconstruction were prospectively enrolled. Exclusion criteria involved patients with a history of bleeding diathesis, renal dysfunction, chronic analgesia use, or alcohol abuse. Eligible patients were randomized into one of two groups. The control group received a standard-of-care pain protocol involving oxycodone-acetaminophen 5 to 325 on discharge. The ketorolac group additionally received intravenous ketorolac postoperatively and 3 days of oral ketorolac on discharge. Pain levels and total narcotic utilization were recorded three times per day for the first 5 days after surgery. Pain and functional outcomes were obtained at 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively.         Results:~         The final analysis included 48 patients; the mean age of the cohort was 32 ± 11.6 years, and 60.4\% of patients were female. No differences were observed in preoperative demographics, comorbidities, and preoperative functional scores between the two groups. Over the first 5 days after surgery, patients in the ketorolac group consumed a mean of 45.4\% fewer narcotic pills than the control group (P {$<$} 0.001). In addition, mean postoperative pain scores were 22.36 points lower for patients in the ketorolac group (P {$<$} 0.001). There was no difference in functional outcome scores at up to 6 weeks postoperatively or adverse events between the two groups with no reported cases of gastrointestinal bleeding.         Discussion:~         The use of adjunctive intravenous and short-term oral ketorolac substantially reduces narcotic utilization and pain levels after ACL reconstruction.

Cross-sectional study involving 225 participants (126 PLWH on antiretroviral therapy [ART] and 99 persons without HIV). For the first time in HIV, we used Cognivue®, an food and drug administration (FDA)-approved computer-based test to assess cognitive function. The test was calibrated to individuals’ unique cognitive ability and measured 6 cognitive domains and 2 performance parameters. Markers of inflammation, immune activation, insulin resistance, and body fat composition (using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan) were collected. Classical t tests, chi-square tests, and spearman correlations were used to compare and explore relationships between variables. Inverse probability weighting adjusted average treatment effect models were performed to evaluate the differences between PLWH and persons without HIV, adjusting for age, race, sex, and heroin use. Overall, 64\% were male, 46\% were Black, with a mean age of 43 years. Among PLWH, 83\% had an undetectable HIV-1 RNA level (≤20 copies/mL). Compared persons without HIV, PLWH performed poorer across 4 domains: visuospatial (P = .035), executive function (P = .029), naming/language (P = .027), and abstraction (P = .018). In addition, PLWH had a significantly longer processing speed time compared to controls (1686.0\,ms vs 1606.0\,ms [P = .007]). In PLWH, lower cognitive testing domain scores were associated with higher inflammatory markers (high sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP]) and with higher total fat and visceral adipose tissue (P {$<$} .05).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The current opioid epidemic in the United States has become a public health crisis with an estimated 150 daily deaths and nearly 47,000 opioid-related deaths in the United States in 2017 alone. Sensible prescriber practice changes have been a focus of policymakers to decrease the total number of narcotic pain medications in circulation. In the state of Ohio, opioid prescription limits for acute pain were enacted in August 2017. However, given the association of acute opioid exposure with long-term use and lack of assessment of these policies, there is an unmet need to evaluate the effects of similar legislation in Ohio on postoperative opioid dosing after shoulder arthroplasty. This study evaluates the effects of opioid prescription-limiting legislation in Ohio on postoperative opioid dosing in shoulder arthroplasty and assesses risk factors related to long-term opioid use. METHODS: All patients undergoing primary and revision shoulder arthroplasty over a 5-year period performed by a single surgeon were included. The pre-legislation (PRE) and post-legislation (POST) groups were defined as patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty before August 31, 2017 and on or after August 31, 2017, respectively. The Ohio Automated Rx Reporting System was queried for controlled-substance prescriptions from 30 days preoperatively to 90 days postoperatively. Patients were designated as opioid tolerant if they had filled an opioid prescription within 30 days of surgery. A binary logistic regression analysis was applied to assess factors related to long-term opioid use. RESULTS: A total of 334 patients were categorized into 2 cohorts: PRE (n = 99) and POST (n = 235). Accounting for legislative effects, we observed significant reductions in cumulative morphine milligram equivalent (MME) dosing in the opioid-naive patients in the 7-day and 30-day postoperative periods (450.0 MMEs in PRE group vs. 210.0 MMEs in POST group, P {$<$} .001) and in the opioid-tolerant patients in the 7-day postoperative period (450.0 MMEs in PRE group vs. 250.0 MMEs in POST group, P = .001). Among the opioid-naive patients, the POST group had a significant MME reduction in the 90-day postoperative period relative to the PRE cohort (P {$<$} .001). Preoperative opioid tolerance and benzodiazepine tolerance were independent risk factors for increased MME dosing at 90 days postoperatively (P {$<$} .001 and P = .02, respectively). CONCLUSION: Opioid prescription-limiting legislation for acute pain in the state of Ohio is associated with a notable reduction in opioid MME dosing in the 90-day postoperative period after shoulder arthroplasty, particularly in opioid-naive patients in the first 30 days postoperatively. Preoperative opioid tolerance is correlated with significantly higher MME dosing postoperatively after shoulder arthroplasty.},

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: Adolescents with perinatally acquired HIV (PHIV) and HIV-uninfected adolescents between 10 and 18years living near Kampala, Uganda were included. Daily ambient concentrations of particulate matter (PM2.5) were measured from the Eastern Arica GEOHealth Hub. Outcome variables measured were carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), as well as plasma markers of systemic inflammation, oxidized lipids, and gut integrity. Multivariable quantile regression models were used to explore the relationship between PM2.5 and IMT. RESULTS: One hundred and nineteen participants (69 PHIV, 50 HIV-uninfected) were included. The median (Q1, Q3) age was 12.7 (11.4,14.2) years, 55\% were girls. Median daily PM2.5 exposure was 29.08{$\mkern1mu$}μg/m3 (23.40, 41.70).

PM2.5 significantly correlated with intestinal permeability (zonulin; r{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.43, P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.001), monocyte activation (soluble CD163: r{$\mkern1mu$} ={$\mkern1mu$}0.25, P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.053), and IMT (r{$\mkern1mu$} ={$\mkern1mu$}0.35, P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.004) in PHIV but not in HIV-uninfected (P{$\mkern1mu$}≥{$\mkern1mu$}0.05). In multivariable quantile regression, after adjusting for age, sex, poverty level, soluble CD163, and zonulin, daily PM2.5 concentrations remained associated with IMT [β{$\mkern1mu$} ={$\mkern1mu$}0.005, 95\% CI (0.0003-0.010), P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.037] in adolescents with PHIV. CONCLUSION: Adolescents in urban Uganda are exposed to high levels of air pollution. Both PM2.5 and HIV have independently been observed to contribute to atherosclerotic disease, and our findings suggest the combined effects of HIV and air pollution may amplify the development of cardiovascular disease.},

The intervention arm received teaching on social (help-seeking), personal (self-help) resourcefulness skills; access to the intervention video and skill application video-vignettes; four weeks of skills reinforcement using daily logs; four weekly phone contacts; and booster sessions at two- and four-month postenrollment. The attention control arm received phone contact at identical time points plus the current standard of care. Statistically significant improvement was noted; fewer depressive cognitions and improved physical health for the intervention participants than attention control participants over time after controlling for covariates. The findings support the resourcefulness intervention efficacy.},

Using three waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study from a sample of 7,503 older adults, we first performed latent class analysis (LCA) to identify productive activity patterns based on four activities (work, caregiving, informal help, and formal volunteering). Next, multilevel regression analyses were conducted to assess the association between the identified productive activity patterns and functional health trajectories among older adults. Four productive activity patterns are identified from LCA: nonengagers, working-caregivers, workers, and helpers. We find that participation in productive activities is associated with slower functional health decline. The moderation effects of urban/rural differences are prominent across identified groups. Our findings highlight the importance of the urban/rural context in understanding productive aging and its health consequences among Chinese older adults.},

Extended Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate the relative risk of driving cessation on mortality. Results: Mortality risk was 1.36 (CI = [1.06, 1.73]) times higher for nondrivers than drivers. This relationship was significantly mediated by health status in the overall sample. Physical health and cognitive health fully mediated the association between driving cessation and mortality among older men, whereas the mediation effects were partial among older women. Discussion: Gender differences in driving patterns may account for the differential mediation effects in the association between driving cessation and mortality.},

Yet, it has been inconclusive about the relative importance of the determinants of active aging. By applying a machine learning approach, this study aims to identify the most important determinants of active aging in 3 domains, i.e., paid/unpaid work, caregiving, and social activities, among Chinese older adults. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were drawn from the first wave of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, which surveys a nationally representative sample of adults aged 60 years and older (N = 7,503). We estimated Random Forest and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression models (LASSO) to determine the most important factors related to active aging. RESULTS: Health has a generic effect on all outcomes of active aging. Our findings also identified the domain-specific determinants of active aging. Urban/rural residency is among the most important factors determining the likelihood of engaging in paid/unpaid work. Living in a multigenerational household is especially important in predicting caregiving activities. Neighborhood infrastructure and facilities have the strongest influence on older adults' participation in social activities. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The application of feature selection models provides a fruitful first step in identifying the most important determinants of active aging among Chinese older adults. These results provide evidence-based recommendations for policies and practices promoting active aging.},

  abstract = {Introduction Evidence on the association between oral health and mortality is inconclusive, and few studies have accounted for the nonrandom selection bias in estimating their relationship. This study aims to investigate the link between oral health and mortality in community-dwelling older adults by adjusting for confounding factors with a doubly robust survival estimation. Methods Data came from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988–1994) and were linked to the National Death Index mortality data through December 2015. The analytic sample consisted of 4,880 adults aged ≥60 years. Oral health measures included objective clinical indicators (edentulism, periodontitis, and untreated dental caries) and self–rated oral health. Cox proportional hazards regression models and inverse probability weighting with regression adjustment for observational survival-time estimation were utilized to assess the relationship between oral health and mortality. Analyses were conducted in 2021. Results Edentulism (average treatment effect= −26.13, 95\% CI= −48.69, −3.57) was associated with a reduction in survival time. Periodontal conditions and dental caries were related to all-cause mortality in Cox models but became nonsignificant when inverse probability weighting with regression adjustment survival estimation was applied. Good self–rated oral health was significantly related to an increase in survival time (average treatment effect=21.50; 95\% CI= 4.92, 38.07). Conclusions Both objective and subjective oral health are risk factors for mortality among older adults. Improving access to dental screening and treatment among community-dwelling older adults has the potential to reduce oral health‒related risks of mortality.},
