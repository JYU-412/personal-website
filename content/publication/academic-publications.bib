  abstract = {Social inequality has grown dramatically in many societies over the last several decades, compelling attention to its causes and consequences. This chapter reviews the issue of life course inequality from a cohort-based perspective. Much work using this approach has focused on economic inequality, often emphasizing its links to health and other consequential domains. The tendency for economic inequality to increase over the life course has been observed in numerous advanced industrial societies. Both sociological and psychological accounts have been offered to account for this phenomenon. In sociology, the cumulative dis/advantage (CDA) approach has identified social processes operating at macro-, meso- and micro-levels that serve to generate and sustain increases in inequality over the life course, By contrast, the notion of psychosocial accentuation is sometimes advanced by psychologists to suggest that increasing inequality results from individual-level differences in talent and effort. One way to ‘test’ these two competing hypotheses – both purporting to account for intra-cohort increases in inequality – is, ironically, to examine within-cohort patterns comparatively between cohorts, or across societal settings. That is because if trajectories of inequality are influenced by social processes, they could be expected to vary between cohorts (or societies) that encounter different social policies and/or historical events. However, if increasing inequality occurs as a simple consequence of the distribution of individual talents, such trajectories should be little disturbed by historical events, policy innovations or other forms of social change. Available evidence suggests that, at least for the measure of income, changes in economic conditions, social policy and other relevant characteristics have been associated with alterations in the patterning of life course inequality.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In this study, we explored the effect of zinc supplementation on markers of inflammation and monocyte activation in antiretroviral therapy-treated HIV infection. METHODS: This is a phase I open-labeled randomized double-arm study, exploring the efficacy and safety of zinc supplementation on inflammation in ≥18-year-old people living with HIV in the US, on stable antiretroviral therapy and with zinc levels ≤75 µg/dL in the last 60 days. Patients were randomized 1:1 to zinc gluconate capsules at a dose of 45 mg (low-dose), or 90 mg (high-dose) elemental zinc daily for 16 weeks. We assessed inflammatory and gut integrity biomarkers at baseline and 16 weeks. RESULTS: Overall, a total of 52 participants were enrolled (25 participants in the low-dose arm and 27 participants in the high-dose arm). Median (Interquartile range) age was 49 (38, 60) years, 77\% were men and 73\% were African Americans. At baseline, median zinc levels were 73 (64, 86) µg/dL. Median circulating zinc levels increased to 91 µg/dL in the low-dose arm and to 100 µg/dL in the high-dose arm. Overall, 48\%-60\% of participants experienced a reduction in biomarkers levels. The margin of reduction ranged between 8\% and 21\%. This change was meaningful with large effect size (Cohen D ranging from 5 to 19). CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, we found that zinc supplementation is effective at increasing circulating zinc levels. In addition, our findings provide novel data suggesting that zinc can affect a biological signature in people living with HIV and modulate biomarkers associated with clinical comorbidities.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is evidence for endothelial dysfunction in youth living with perinatally acquired HIV (YLPHIV). However, little data exist on its mechanisms. METHODS: YLPHIV and age-matched HIV-uninfected (HIV-) youth enrolled in the Cape Town Adolescent Antiretroviral Cohort in South Africa between 9 and 14 years of age were included. YLPHIV were on antiretroviral therapy more than 6 months with viral load less than 400 copies/ml at baseline and 24 months. Serum biomarkers of systemic inflammation, monocyte activation, intestinal integrity, and oxidized LDL-cholesterol were measured at baseline and after 24 months. Endothelial function was measured at 24 months using reactive hyperemic index (RHI); endothelial dysfunction was defined as RHI less than 1.35. Spearman correlation coefficient and quantile regression were used to examine associations between RHI and different biomarkers. RESULTS: We included 266 YLPHIV and 69 HIV- participants. At baseline, median (Q1, Q3) age was 12 (11, 13) years and 53\% were females. YLPHIV had poorer endothelial function compared with HIV- youth (RHI{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1.36 vs. 1.52, P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.01). At baseline and 24 months, YLPHIV had higher markers of monocyte activation (soluble CD14), gut barrier dysfunction (intestinal fatty acid binding protein) and oxidized LDL-cholesterol (P{$\mkern1mu$}≤{$\mkern1mu$}0.04) compared with HIV- youth. Among YLPHIV, soluble CD14 remained associated with endothelial dysfunction after adjusting for age, sex, Tanner stage, and antiretroviral therapy duration (β: -0.05, P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.01). CONCLUSION: Despite viral suppression, South African YLPHIV have poor endothelial function and persistent evidence of monocyte activation and gut barrier dysfunction compared with HIV- youth. The long-term clinical significance of gut integrity and monocyte activation needs to be further assessed in YLPHIV.},

The relationships among the lipidome, immune activation, and subclinical vascular disease in children with perinatally acquired HIV (PHIV) have not been investigated. METHODS: Serum lipid composition, including 13 lipid classes constituting 850 different lipid species were measured by direct infusion-tandem mass spectrometry in samples from 20 ART-treated PHIV and 20 age-matched and sex-matched HIV- Ugandan children. All participants were between 10 and 18{$\mkern1mu$}years of age with no other known active infections. PHIVs had HIV-1 RNA level 50{$\mkern1mu$}copies/ml or less. In addition, common carotid artery intima--media thickness (IMT), as well as plasma marker of systemic inflammation (hsCRP, IL6, sTNFRa I), monocyte activation (soluble CD14 and CD163), and T-cell activation (expression of CD38 and HLA-DR on CD4+ and CD8+) were evaluated. RESULTS: Median age (Q1, Q3) of study participants was 13{$\mkern1mu$}years (11, 15), 37\% were boys, 75\% were on an NNRTI-based ART regimen. The concentrations of cholesterol ester, LCER, phosphatidylcholines, and sphingomyelin lipid classes were significantly increased in serum of PHIV compared with HIV (P≤0.04). Biomarkers associated with CVD risk including hsCRP, sCD163, and T-cell activation were directly correlated with lipid species in PHIV (P{$\mkern1mu$}≤{$\mkern1mu$}0.04). Contents of free fatty acids including palmitic (16{$\mkern1mu$}:{$\mkern1mu$}0), stearic (18{$\mkern1mu$}:{$\mkern1mu$}0), and arachidic acid (20{$\mkern1mu$}:{$\mkern1mu$}0) were positively correlated with IMT in PHIV. CONCLUSION: Serum lipidome is altered in young virally suppressed PHIV on ART. A direct association between inflammation and lipid species known to be associated with CVD was observed.},

  abstract = {Background:~         Predicting ultimate lower extremity length is important in the treatment of lower limb length discrepancy (LLD), congenital limb deficiency, and other etiologies. Utilizing skeletal age over chronological age improves the prediction of ultimate lower extremity length. The recently described modified Fels knee skeletal maturity system allows for skeletal age estimation via imaging always available in LLD patients. We sought to compare the accuracy of the modified Fels knee skeletal maturity system versus chronological age in ultimate limb length prediction of a modern adolescent clinical population.         Methods:~         The medical records of all patients treated at our institution over a 20-year period with unilateral lower extremity pathology and available lower extremity imaging before and after reaching skeletal maturity were reviewed. Skeletal maturity was defined radiographically by closed distal femoral, proximal tibial, and proximal fibular physes. The femoral, tibial, and lower extremity length was measured in all radiographs. The modified Fels knee skeletal maturity system was applied to all radiographs obtained before maturity to estimate skeletal age. The accuracy of 3 widely utilized lower extremity length prediction systems was compared when utilizing estimated Fels skeletal age versus chronological age inputs.         Results:~         A total of 245 radiographs (109 before maturity) from 43 patients were eligible for inclusion. On cross-sectional analysis, linear modeling using Fels skeletal ages was uniformly associated with higher (improved) R2 values than chronological age-based models. On longitudinal analysis, skeletal age mixed-effects models had significantly lower (improved) Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion values than chronological age models in all cases. Cohen d values were also significantly different (P{$<$}0.05) for the skeletal age models compared with chronological age models in all cases.         Conclusions:~         In the treatment of LLD, the modified Fels knee skeletal maturity system can be readily applied to available imaging to improve the prediction of ultimate femoral, tibial, and lower extremity length. This skeletal maturity system may have significant utility in the estimation of ultimate LLD and determination of appropriate timing of epiphysiodesis.         Level of Evidence:~         Level III.},

We also examine the influence of physicians' emotional support and patients' demographic as well as health characteristics on patients' satisfaction. SAMPLE: Our sample includes interviews with 806 community dwelling older adults (mean age =77.82 years, SD=8.41). The sample included residents of a large retirement community in Clearwater, FL, USA. Respondents were also included from representative samples of older adults living in Orlando and Miami, FL, USA, and Cleveland, OH, USA. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using multiple hierarchical regression analyses, we found that patients' age and functional limitations were negatively associated with their care satisfaction. When compared with White patients, African-American patients were less satisfied with their physicians while Latino patients expressed greater satisfaction with their medical care. We found limited evidence of patients' self-advocacy and such advocacy did not serve as a significant predictor of satisfaction with physicians. In contrast, patients' perception of physicians' readiness to act as patient advocates was a significant predictor of patients' satisfaction. Emotional support of physicians was also associated with patients' satisfaction. CONCLUSION: These findings raise questions about consumer empowerment among older adults and underscore their desire for and appreciation of physicians' advocacy. Findings are discussed in the context of power imbalance between elderly patients and their doctors.},

  abstract = {Introduction:~         Successful outpatient anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction hinges on effective analgesia. Routinely, oral narcotic agents have been the preferred analgesic postoperatively in orthopaedic surgery. However, these agents have several known adverse effects and are associated with a potential for abuse. This study evaluates the efficacy of ketorolac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with analgesic properties, as an adjuvant agent for postoperative pain control after ACL reconstruction.         Methods:~         Adult patients undergoing primary ACL reconstruction were prospectively enrolled. Exclusion criteria involved patients with a history of bleeding diathesis, renal dysfunction, chronic analgesia use, or alcohol abuse. Eligible patients were randomized into one of two groups. The control group received a standard-of-care pain protocol involving oxycodone-acetaminophen 5 to 325 on discharge. The ketorolac group additionally received intravenous ketorolac postoperatively and 3 days of oral ketorolac on discharge. Pain levels and total narcotic utilization were recorded three times per day for the first 5 days after surgery. Pain and functional outcomes were obtained at 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively.         Results:~         The final analysis included 48 patients; the mean age of the cohort was 32 ± 11.6 years, and 60.4\% of patients were female. No differences were observed in preoperative demographics, comorbidities, and preoperative functional scores between the two groups. Over the first 5 days after surgery, patients in the ketorolac group consumed a mean of 45.4\% fewer narcotic pills than the control group (P {$<$} 0.001). In addition, mean postoperative pain scores were 22.36 points lower for patients in the ketorolac group (P {$<$} 0.001). There was no difference in functional outcome scores at up to 6 weeks postoperatively or adverse events between the two groups with no reported cases of gastrointestinal bleeding.         Discussion:~         The use of adjunctive intravenous and short-term oral ketorolac substantially reduces narcotic utilization and pain levels after ACL reconstruction.

Cross-sectional study involving 225 participants (126 PLWH on antiretroviral therapy [ART] and 99 persons without HIV). For the first time in HIV, we used Cognivue®, an food and drug administration (FDA)-approved computer-based test to assess cognitive function. The test was calibrated to individuals’ unique cognitive ability and measured 6 cognitive domains and 2 performance parameters. Markers of inflammation, immune activation, insulin resistance, and body fat composition (using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan) were collected. Classical t tests, chi-square tests, and spearman correlations were used to compare and explore relationships between variables. Inverse probability weighting adjusted average treatment effect models were performed to evaluate the differences between PLWH and persons without HIV, adjusting for age, race, sex, and heroin use. Overall, 64\% were male, 46\% were Black, with a mean age of 43 years. Among PLWH, 83\% had an undetectable HIV-1 RNA level (≤20 copies/mL). Compared persons without HIV, PLWH performed poorer across 4 domains: visuospatial (P = .035), executive function (P = .029), naming/language (P = .027), and abstraction (P = .018). In addition, PLWH had a significantly longer processing speed time compared to controls (1686.0\,ms vs 1606.0\,ms [P = .007]). In PLWH, lower cognitive testing domain scores were associated with higher inflammatory markers (high sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP]) and with higher total fat and visceral adipose tissue (P {$<$} .05).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The current opioid epidemic in the United States has become a public health crisis with an estimated 150 daily deaths and nearly 47,000 opioid-related deaths in the United States in 2017 alone. Sensible prescriber practice changes have been a focus of policymakers to decrease the total number of narcotic pain medications in circulation. In the state of Ohio, opioid prescription limits for acute pain were enacted in August 2017. However, given the association of acute opioid exposure with long-term use and lack of assessment of these policies, there is an unmet need to evaluate the effects of similar legislation in Ohio on postoperative opioid dosing after shoulder arthroplasty. This study evaluates the effects of opioid prescription-limiting legislation in Ohio on postoperative opioid dosing in shoulder arthroplasty and assesses risk factors related to long-term opioid use. METHODS: All patients undergoing primary and revision shoulder arthroplasty over a 5-year period performed by a single surgeon were included. The pre-legislation (PRE) and post-legislation (POST) groups were defined as patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty before August 31, 2017 and on or after August 31, 2017, respectively. The Ohio Automated Rx Reporting System was queried for controlled-substance prescriptions from 30 days preoperatively to 90 days postoperatively. Patients were designated as opioid tolerant if they had filled an opioid prescription within 30 days of surgery. A binary logistic regression analysis was applied to assess factors related to long-term opioid use. RESULTS: A total of 334 patients were categorized into 2 cohorts: PRE (n = 99) and POST (n = 235). Accounting for legislative effects, we observed significant reductions in cumulative morphine milligram equivalent (MME) dosing in the opioid-naive patients in the 7-day and 30-day postoperative periods (450.0 MMEs in PRE group vs. 210.0 MMEs in POST group, P {$<$} .001) and in the opioid-tolerant patients in the 7-day postoperative period (450.0 MMEs in PRE group vs. 250.0 MMEs in POST group, P = .001). Among the opioid-naive patients, the POST group had a significant MME reduction in the 90-day postoperative period relative to the PRE cohort (P {$<$} .001). Preoperative opioid tolerance and benzodiazepine tolerance were independent risk factors for increased MME dosing at 90 days postoperatively (P {$<$} .001 and P = .02, respectively). CONCLUSION: Opioid prescription-limiting legislation for acute pain in the state of Ohio is associated with a notable reduction in opioid MME dosing in the 90-day postoperative period after shoulder arthroplasty, particularly in opioid-naive patients in the first 30 days postoperatively. Preoperative opioid tolerance is correlated with significantly higher MME dosing postoperatively after shoulder arthroplasty.},

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: Adolescents with perinatally acquired HIV (PHIV) and HIV-uninfected adolescents between 10 and 18years living near Kampala, Uganda were included. Daily ambient concentrations of particulate matter (PM2.5) were measured from the Eastern Arica GEOHealth Hub. Outcome variables measured were carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), as well as plasma markers of systemic inflammation, oxidized lipids, and gut integrity. Multivariable quantile regression models were used to explore the relationship between PM2.5 and IMT. RESULTS: One hundred and nineteen participants (69 PHIV, 50 HIV-uninfected) were included. The median (Q1, Q3) age was 12.7 (11.4,14.2) years, 55\% were girls. Median daily PM2.5 exposure was 29.08{$\mkern1mu$}μg/m3 (23.40, 41.70).

PM2.5 significantly correlated with intestinal permeability (zonulin; r{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.43, P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.001), monocyte activation (soluble CD163: r{$\mkern1mu$} ={$\mkern1mu$}0.25, P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.053), and IMT (r{$\mkern1mu$} ={$\mkern1mu$}0.35, P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.004) in PHIV but not in HIV-uninfected (P{$\mkern1mu$}≥{$\mkern1mu$}0.05). In multivariable quantile regression, after adjusting for age, sex, poverty level, soluble CD163, and zonulin, daily PM2.5 concentrations remained associated with IMT [β{$\mkern1mu$} ={$\mkern1mu$}0.005, 95\% CI (0.0003-0.010), P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.037] in adolescents with PHIV. CONCLUSION: Adolescents in urban Uganda are exposed to high levels of air pollution. Both PM2.5 and HIV have independently been observed to contribute to atherosclerotic disease, and our findings suggest the combined effects of HIV and air pollution may amplify the development of cardiovascular disease.},

Yet, it has been inconclusive about the relative importance of the determinants of active aging. By applying a machine learning approach, this study aims to identify the most important determinants of active aging in 3 domains, i.e., paid/unpaid work, caregiving, and social activities, among Chinese older adults. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were drawn from the first wave of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, which surveys a nationally representative sample of adults aged 60 years and older (N = 7,503). We estimated Random Forest and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression models (LASSO) to determine the most important factors related to active aging. RESULTS: Health has a generic effect on all outcomes of active aging. Our findings also identified the domain-specific determinants of active aging. Urban/rural residency is among the most important factors determining the likelihood of engaging in paid/unpaid work. Living in a multigenerational household is especially important in predicting caregiving activities. Neighborhood infrastructure and facilities have the strongest influence on older adults' participation in social activities. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The application of feature selection models provides a fruitful first step in identifying the most important determinants of active aging among Chinese older adults. These results provide evidence-based recommendations for policies and practices promoting active aging.},

  abstract = {Introduction Evidence on the association between oral health and mortality is inconclusive, and few studies have accounted for the nonrandom selection bias in estimating their relationship. This study aims to investigate the link between oral health and mortality in community-dwelling older adults by adjusting for confounding factors with a doubly robust survival estimation. Methods Data came from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988–1994) and were linked to the National Death Index mortality data through December 2015. The analytic sample consisted of 4,880 adults aged ≥60 years. Oral health measures included objective clinical indicators (edentulism, periodontitis, and untreated dental caries) and self–rated oral health. Cox proportional hazards regression models and inverse probability weighting with regression adjustment for observational survival-time estimation were utilized to assess the relationship between oral health and mortality. Analyses were conducted in 2021. Results Edentulism (average treatment effect= −26.13, 95\% CI= −48.69, −3.57) was associated with a reduction in survival time. Periodontal conditions and dental caries were related to all-cause mortality in Cox models but became nonsignificant when inverse probability weighting with regression adjustment survival estimation was applied. Good self–rated oral health was significantly related to an increase in survival time (average treatment effect=21.50; 95\% CI= 4.92, 38.07). Conclusions Both objective and subjective oral health are risk factors for mortality among older adults. Improving access to dental screening and treatment among community-dwelling older adults has the potential to reduce oral health‒related risks of mortality.},

Armed conflict disrupts people’s lives, often limiting access to essential resources and healthcare services (e.g., abortion-related healthcare). We investigated the relationship between armed conflict and pregnancy termination among pregnant women (aged 15–49) in Burkina Faso using health data from the Performance Monitoring for Action (PMA) project and armed conflict event data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Project (UCDP). We found that pregnancies exposed to armed conflict in the first trimester were less likely to end in pregnancy termination compared to pregnancies that were not exposed to armed conflict in the first trimester, though we are unable to disentangle spontaneous versus induced terminations in these data. Thus, we cannot determine whether this finding is driven largely by one type of abortion or another, nor can we be sure that the effects are not counteracting each other. Because interruption of healthcare access is a common consequence of armed conflict, abortion-related services should be targeted and adapted to suit the specific needs and obstacles faced by pregnant women in conflict-affected places.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neighborhood factors of social isolation have been understudied, hindering efforts to reduce social isolation at the neighborhood level. This study aims to investigate the longitudinal effects of neighborhood social cohesion and physical disorder on social isolation in community-dwelling older adults, as well as to examine whether race/ethnicity moderates the neighborhood-isolation relationship. METHODS: We used 11-year data from the National Health and Aging Trend Study, a longitudinal national study of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older. Social isolation was measured through a summary score across four domains: marital/partner status, family and friend contact, religious attendance, and club participation. A series of weighted mixed-effects logistic regression models were performed to test the study aims. Sample sizes ranged from 7,303 to 7,291 across individual domains of social isolation. RESULTS: Approximately 20\% of participants reported social isolation. Findings indicated a negative association between neighborhood social cohesion and social isolation. Higher levels of neighborhood social cohesion were longitudinally associated with lower odds of social isolation (odds ratio [OR]\,=\,0.52, 95\% CI: 0.47-0.58). Yet, the presence of neighborhood physical disorder was associated with an increased risk of overall social isolation ([OR]\,=\,1.2, 95\% CI: 1.00, 1.44). Race/ethnicity significantly moderated the effects of neighborhood social cohesion and physical disorder on social isolation. The odds of no in-person visits associated with neighborhood social cohesion are smaller among Black adults compared to White adults. Black adults had constantly lower odds of isolation from religious attendance compared to White adults regardless of the level of neighborhood social cohesion. Hispanic adults had decreased odds of having no friends associated with signs of physical disorder, while no associations were found among older White adults. White adults had higher odds of isolation from in-person visits when living in neighborhoods with signs of physical disorder, whereas no association was observed among older Black and Hispanic adults. CONCLUSIONS: This study elucidates the role of neighborhood characteristics in shaping social isolation dynamics among older adults. Furthermore, the observed moderation effects of race/ethnicity suggest the need for culturally sensitive interventions tailored to address social isolation within specific neighborhood and racial contexts.},

Methods We performed a case-control study of 361 participants of the Dallas Heart Study, including 88 participants with an incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event and 273 controls matched for age, sex, and body mass index without an ASCVD event during 12 years of follow-up (January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2015). Plasma levels of TMAO, choline, carnitine, betaine, and butyrobetaine were measured by mass spectrometry. The differential odds for incident ASCVD by metabolite levels between cases and controls were compared by a conditional logistic regression model adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors. Results Participants with incident ASCVD had higher levels of TMAO and related metabolites compared with those without ASCVD (P{$<$}.05 for all). Those with plasma TMAO concentrations in quartile 4 had a more than 2-fold higher odds of ASCVD compared with those in quartile 1 (odds ratio, 2.77 [95\% CI, 1.05 to 7.7; P=.04] for hard ASCVD and 2.41 [95\% CI, 1.049 to 5.709; P=.04]). Similar trends were seen with the related metabolites choline, betaine, carnitine, and butyrobetaine. Conclusion Our results suggest that TMAO and related metabolites are independently associated with ASCVD events. Although further studies are needed, measurement of TMAO and related metabolites may have a role in ASCVD risk stratification for primary prevention.},

While the unpredictable nature of the pandemic was prompting some women to delay pregnancies, the pandemic was potentially limiting access to reproductive health services due to supply shortages, fears of virus exposure, and mobility restrictions. In this study, we used longitudinal data from Kenya and Burkina Faso and applied a multilevel perspective to better understand the factors contributing to change or persistence in contraceptive use during the early months of the pandemic. We found a marginal increase in contraceptive uptake in the early days of the pandemic. Multilevel logistic regression results revealed that interpersonal trust and accurate knowledge of COVID-19 precautions were associated with a greater likelihood of initiating contraception. These factors appeared to have provided women with confidence to navigate the complicated COVID-19 landscape. At the same time, we observed a decrease in contraceptive use in regions with high COVID-19 cases, suggesting the virus was limiting access to contraception in some contexts. These findings highlighted the need for public health officials to ensure that women have the necessary knowledge and ability to safely access contraception during public health crises, when overall demand for contraception may be increasing.},
