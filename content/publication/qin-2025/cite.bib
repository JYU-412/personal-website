 abstract = {ObjectivesThis study investigates whether neighborhood disorder has indirect effects on inflammation via health behaviors and whether the pathways vary by race and ethnicity.MethodsThe study sample came from the Health and Retirement Study in 2014 and 2016. Inflammation level was assessed with C-reactive protein. Neighborhood disorder and health behaviors were self-reported. Structural equation modeling was conducted to test the objectives.ResultsFindings revealed significant direct effects of neighborhood disorder on inflammation (B = 0.034, 95% CI: 0.009, 0.058) and indirect effects via physical activity (B = 0.010, 95% CI: 0.006, 0.014). Neighborhood disorder was linked to inflammation through physical activity among older White adults, but not among older Black and Hispanic adults.DiscussionInterventions to provide opportunities for physical activity may reduce inflammation levels among older adults living in neighborhoods with disorders. Future research may consider unique social experiences influencing inflammation among older Black and Hispanic adults.},
