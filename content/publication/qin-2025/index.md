abstract: 'ObjectivesThis study investigates whether neighborhood disorder has indirect
  effects on inflammation via health behaviors and whether the pathways vary by race
  and ethnicity.MethodsThe study sample came from the Health and Retirement Study
  in 2014 and 2016. Inflammation level was assessed with C-reactive protein. Neighborhood
  disorder and health behaviors were self-reported. Structural equation modeling was
  conducted to test the objectives.ResultsFindings revealed significant direct effects
  of neighborhood disorder on inflammation (B = 0.034, 95% CI: 0.009, 0.058) and indirect
  effects via physical activity (B = 0.010, 95% CI: 0.006, 0.014). Neighborhood disorder
  was linked to inflammation through physical activity among older White adults, but
  not among older Black and Hispanic adults.DiscussionInterventions to provide opportunities
  for physical activity may reduce inflammation levels among older adults living in
  neighborhoods with disorders. Future research may consider unique social experiences
  influencing inflammation among older Black and Hispanic adults.'
