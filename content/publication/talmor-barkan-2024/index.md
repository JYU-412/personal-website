abstract: Objective To evaluate the association between trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)
  and related metabolites with adverse cardiovascular events in a multiethnic urban
  primary prevention population. Methods We performed a case-control study of 361
  participants of the Dallas Heart Study, including 88 participants with an incident
  atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event and 273 controls matched for
  age, sex, and body mass index without an ASCVD event during 12 years of follow-up
  (January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2015). Plasma levels of TMAO, choline, carnitine,
  betaine, and butyrobetaine were measured by mass spectrometry. The differential
  odds for incident ASCVD by metabolite levels between cases and controls were compared
  by a conditional logistic regression model adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors.
  Results Participants with incident ASCVD had higher levels of TMAO and related metabolites
  compared with those without ASCVD (P$<$.05 for all). Those with plasma TMAO concentrations
  in quartile 4 had a more than 2-fold higher odds of ASCVD compared with those in
  quartile 1 (odds ratio, 2.77 [95% CI, 1.05 to 7.7; P=.04] for hard ASCVD and 2.41
  [95% CI, 1.049 to 5.709; P=.04]). Similar trends were seen with the related metabolites
  choline, betaine, carnitine, and butyrobetaine. Conclusion Our results suggest that
  TMAO and related metabolites are independently associated with ASCVD events. Although
  further studies are needed, measurement of TMAO and related metabolites may have
  a role in ASCVD risk stratification for primary prevention.
